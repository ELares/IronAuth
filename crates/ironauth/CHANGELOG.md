# ironauth changelog

All notable changes to the `ironauth` binary. Format: keep a section per
released version, newest first; every release names the artifact and version
range per docs/RELEASING.md.

## Unreleased

- Mount the OIDC provider (issue #12) on the PUBLIC plane when `oidc.enabled` is
  set, connecting the data-plane store with `database.url`. Per-environment
  signing-key provisioning is a later milestone: until an environment has a key,
  its token endpoint fails closed (a startup warning says so). Default boot is
  unchanged (unmounted, database-free).
- `ironauth serve [--config PATH]`: loads and strictly validates config,
  surfaces its warnings to the log, wires telemetry, and runs the dual-plane
  server until `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`, draining within the configured grace period.
  The non-default `otlp` feature is forwarded to `ironauth-server`.
- Initial binary: `--version` and `--help` only. The server skeleton lands
  with the M1 server-skeleton issue.
