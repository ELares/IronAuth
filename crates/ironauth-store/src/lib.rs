//! Persistence and tenant isolation layer for IronAuth.
//!
//! Cross-tenant access is the top CVE class for a multi-tenant identity
//! provider: the surveyed field ships isolation by convention (authorization
//! checked per handler) and pays for it in the IDOR family, recycled-identifier
//! leakage, and cross-organization escalation. This crate ships isolation by
//! construction instead, in three layers that all sit BELOW the application:
//!
//! 1. **Typed scoped identifiers.** Every identifier is a non-guessable,
//!    non-recyclable, typed-prefixed token. A scoped resource identifier
//!    ([`ClientId`]) embeds its tenant and environment, so parsing one under the
//!    wrong [`Scope`] fails as a uniform not-found with no existence oracle.
//! 2. **Scope-only repositories.** A repository ([`ClientRepo`]) can only be
//!    built from a [`Scope`] (via [`Store::scoped`]) and applies that scope to
//!    every query itself. The pool and the scoped tables are crate-private, so
//!    no other crate can issue an unscoped query; `scripts/query-audit.sh`
//!    fails the build if scoped-table SQL appears outside the repository
//!    module.
//! 3. **Row-level security** (the migration). Every tenant-scoped table has
//!    Postgres row-level security ENABLED and FORCED, keyed on the
//!    transaction-local session variables the repository binds. Even a bug in
//!    the application layer cannot read another tenant's rows.
//!
//! The four-level resource model (operator, tenant, environment, organization)
//! and the reasoning behind the pooled shared-schema design are recorded in
//! `docs/design/TENANCY.md`. Time and entropy flow through
//! [`ironauth_env`]; identifiers draw randomness only from its entropy seam.
//!
//! Only the runtime sqlx query API is used (never the compile-time-checked
//! `query!` macros), so every database-free CI lane stays database-free; a live
//! database is needed only to run the integration tests.
